# Quick Restart
Quick restart is a fish script that kind of quick restarts your pc

It closes all programs and when you get back to the lock screen the settings gear is there on manjaro

It does all this in just a few seconds

Just remember that this was only tested on manjaro linux with gnome

I dont know what it will do on other distros

# Using this is probably a bad idea
 I made this before I found out that you can switch desktop environments without restarting your pc.

 So yeah this is useless.

 Also it might do stuff to ur pc that isnt good but idk
